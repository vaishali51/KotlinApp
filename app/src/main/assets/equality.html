	<h1>Equality</h1>
	<p>In Kotlin there are two types of equality:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Referential equality (two references point to the same object)</li>
		<li>Structural equality (a check for equals())</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Refrential Equality</h2>
	<p>Referential equality is checked by the === operation (and its negated counterpart !==). a === b evaluates to true if<br> and only if a and b point to the same object.</p>

<h2>Structural Equality</h2>
	<p>Structural equality is checked by the == operation (and its negated counterpart !=). By convention, an expression like<br> a == b is translated to</p>
	<p style="background:#f5f5f5; width:600px; height:50px; border:2px red; padding:15px; color:blue;">a?.equals(b) ?: (b === null)
</p>
<p>I.e. if a is not null, it calls the equals(Any?) function, otherwise (i.e. a is null) it checks <br>that b is referentially equal to null.<br><br>
Note that there's no point in optimizing your code when comparing to null explicitly: a == null <br>will be automatically translated to a === null.</p>
